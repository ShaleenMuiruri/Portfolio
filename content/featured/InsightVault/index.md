AI-powered app that lets users ask questions about their uploaded documents using React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, AWS S3, and Claude.

- Challenge: Allow users to query their own documents for instant answers.
- Approach: Built a full-stack AI-powered app using React and Vite on the frontend, with a Node.js backend, PostgreSQL + pgvector for metadata and embeddings, and AWS S3 for file storage. Implemented a semantic search pipeline that extracts, embeds, and retrieves relevant document chunks, sending context to Claude for natural language answers.
- Impact: Showcased end-to-end AI retrieval with modern web stack—turning static PDFs, DOCX, and TXT files into searchable, intelligent knowledge hubs.
